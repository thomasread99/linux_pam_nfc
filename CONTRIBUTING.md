# Introduction
Hello, and welcome to this project! I am very pleased to have you check it out and would love any contributions you may have. The key premise of this project is a way of unlocking your computer using NFC, ideally in a smartphone. I initially created this for my final university project, but have now opened it up to the community in order to make it the best it possibly can be. This contributing file is quite short for now, but as this project expands I will be updating it more reguarly, so do please keep checking for updates.
<br>
Following these guidelines helps with all aspects of this project, and shows that you respect the efforts of the community. In return, you will receive fast responses to any queries, and as much support as possible for your development work.
<br>
As a student myself, I am more than happy for anyone to work on and contribute to this project, no matter your level of experience! All you need is a positive attitude and a willingness to learn!

# Ground rules
- Always be considerate to other developers on this project - remember, not everyone will be the same skill level
- Do not add any features not already specified to the project unless discussed and approved by the owner
- Be welcoming to newcomers, and give as much help and support as you are able to
- Only work on one feature at a time, keeping the pull requests small for easy reviewing
- Ensure that all code follows the conventions specified
- Discuss everything transparently and get community feedback
- Have fun!

# Your first contribution
Unsure about where to begin? Look at the [Currently required features](#currently-required-features) to see what is needed by the project, and check to see if a branch/pull request already exists for it. There is no contribution too small, so work on any issue/feature that best suits your skill level!

# Currently required features and enhancements
## Priority
- Get project to actually unlock the computer and not just run from the command line
- Use a secure channel for the NFC communication
- UI for adding and managing users
- Create a wiki to fully document this project
- Refactor the code into the shortest/most optimal format

## Extension
*Please get in touch with the owner of this project before attempting anything from this section - thomas@readcode.co.uk*
- Windows/MacOS version

# Getting started
For information on cloning, compiling and running this project, please see the README, and let me know if there are any issues. Once that has been setup, to begin work:
1. Create a new fork for your contribution (see [Conventions](#conventions))
2. Do all your changes on that fork
3. Create a pull request to main once your feature is finished, although keep each pull request to one feature

# How to report a bug
Currently, there is no specific system for reporting bugs. The best way is to get in touch with me via email: thomas@readcode.co.uk and I will add this to the required features and enhancements. Please include information in your email regarding system version, NFC reader version, and how to replicate the issue.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
Once again, there is currently no specific system for suggesting features or enhancements. The best way is to get in touch with me via email: thomas@readcode.co.uk and I will add this to the required features and enhancements.

# Code review process
At this moment in time, any pull requests will be reviewed by me, as and when I can get to them (within a week). Please provide as much description and information as possible in your pull request so I can understand what your change does and how it works. In future, I plan on adding extra reviewers to this process, but that depends on the size of the community and contributors.

# Conventions
## Git conventions
- Name your branches/forks as a maximum of three words describing the change, separated by hypens. eg. fix-encryption-bug
- Give your pull requests meaningful names that accuratley describe what they do
- Provide detailed description for your pull request so that the reviewer can easily tell what it does

## Coding conventions
- Comment your code so it is clear as to what it does
- Use camel casing for variable names and function names
- Keep related functions in one C file, and create new files for unrelated functions
- Put references to everything in the header files

# Where can I ask for help
Anywhere! Get in touch with the community, or feel free to email me at thomas@readcode.co.uk, and I will respond as fast as I can!
